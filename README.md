# Overview

Orbit is a space adventure where the main objective is the reach a goal point without crashing into one of many planets.
The challenge? Each planet has a harsh gravitational pull that will threaten your fragile ship with imminent destruction without careful maneuvering.
Carefully analyzed and calculated movements along with good judgement a quick thinking will be required if you hope to navigate this treacherous galaxy.
Speed running is advised and celebrated. Have fun!

I made this game because the idea of writing a physics engine based around gravity was exciting to me. I lovee games and being able to make one myself
is a whole new kind of thrilling. I had a lot of fun writing this and spent more time than I want to admit watching the patterns of my ship as it orbited
planets. The gravity logic is based on the formula for gravity, because it is the most consistent (go figure).

# Development Environment

I made this game solely using visual studio code. It's a great IDE and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Orbit is written in python using the arcade and math libraries.

# Future Work

* Even more levels!
* 2 player combat mode featuring missiles that are also affected by gravity
* Possibly turrets that automatically fire at the player, adding more complexity to higher levels.
